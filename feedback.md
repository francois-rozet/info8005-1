This is a strong realization showing that the group has understood and tried to exploit systematically the inference potential of an ontology.

The model is well structured and covers the needs of the requirements, including the handling of prerequisite. The reuse of a time ontology, even if not to its full potential,  is a good idea. Locations are correctly handled through transitivity. The model is also systematically populated : all main classes have instances. Moreover, many instances are correctly reclassified making use of inferences. Finally, the model makes extensive use of URIs towards the real linked information of ULIEGE. Annotations to comment the ontology would have been a nice additional touch.

The knowledge base aspects are very well covered : a number of concept descriptions are used, including many equivalence definitions, the structure of properties is rich, making use of subproperties, inverses, and transitivity in addition to domain and range… Inferences are easy to spot.
In addition it is clear from the explanations that the group has focused on that part.

Interfaces and queries were demonstrated effectively with a fair set of queries of good complexity. The OWL API illustrated various features of the reasoner. The Jena interface made a point of showing the effect of inferences of the result of SPARQL even if no RDFS entailment was available, which is very good.

The demo was well prepared and smooth, timing respected; interaction was good. The presentation was showing clearly what the group tried to achieve, showing inferences, discussing limitations… As a (small) comment, the slide talking about the objective to have enough complexity could have used some examples.

Overall a job which covered all bases and tried to identify what the key principles of an ontology were and to illustrate them.
